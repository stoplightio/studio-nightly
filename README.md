# Stoplight Studio (Nightly)

Studio is Stoplight's next generation application for API design, modeling, and technical writing. A primary goal of Studio is to enrich, not replace, your existing workflows. When running locally it works fully offline, with folders and files on your computer just like your favorite IDE. When running in the browser, the web-native Git support allows you to effortlessly work with your existing repositories safely and efficiently.

## What is Nightly

Nightly pre-releases of Studio Desktop. These are inherently less reliable than the [main releases](https://github.com/stoplightio/studio/releases), which go through extra testing and beta testing phases. 

That said, when there's new functionality coming, and you want to see how it works, using the nightly version might be a good way to get a sneak preview before it drops. 

Whatever you chose to do with this nightly build, we do not accept any responsibility for anything that goes wrong. If you lose work, please report the bugs, but do not be upset or surprised.
